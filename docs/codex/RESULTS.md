# Codex experiment results

This file is the durable record of competitive experiments requested by `docs/codex/CURRENT_TASK.md`.

Do not overwrite prior completed experiment sections. Append new dated sections so regressions and successful ideas remain traceable.

## Current reference

Reference champion for the current task:

`e50123cee7d924f0d643acd372a5300971f93917`

The combined selective picker + 3x3 + anti-cycle port is known to regress substantially versus this reference and must not be treated as the new baseline.
